-   Key Definitions:

    -   Atom: The smallest part of an element that can exist.

    -   Element: A substance containing only one type of atom.

    -   Ion: An atom or group of atoms with an electrical charge due to the loss or gain of electrons.

    -   Molecule: A group of atoms chemically bonded together.

    -   Compound: A substance containing two or more elements chemically bonded in fixed proportions.

    -   Empirical Formula: The simplest whole number ratio of atoms of each element in a compound.

    -   Molecular Formula: The actual number of atoms of each element in a molecule.

1.2 The Mole and Calculations

-   The Mole:

    -   A mole is the unit for the amount of substance.

    -   One mole contains 6.02 × 10²³ particles (Avogadro constant, L).

    -   For elements, one mole is the relative atomic mass in grams.

    -   For compounds, one mole is the relative formula mass in grams.

-   Key Terms:

    -   Relative Atomic Mass (Ar): The weighted average mass of an atom compared to 1/12 the mass of a carbon-12 atom.

    -   Relative Molecular Mass (Mr): The sum of the relative atomic masses of all atoms in a molecule.

    -   Relative Formula Mass: Used for compounds with giant structures, calculated like Mr.

    -   Molar Mass: The mass per mole of a substance in g mol⁻¹.

    -   Parts Per Million (ppm): Used for very low concentrations, especially gases in the atmosphere.
        -   ppm = (mass of solute ÷ mass of solution) × 10⁶

1.3 Chemical Equations and Calculations

-   Balanced Equations:

    -   Show the reactants and products in a chemical reaction.

    -   Must have the same number of atoms of each element on both sides.

    -   Include state symbols: (s) solid, (l) liquid, (g) gas, (aq) aqueous.

-   Ionic Equations:

    -   Show only the ions that undergo change in a reaction.

    -   Spectator ions (those not involved in the reaction) are omitted.

-   Reacting Quantities:

    -   Calculations use the principles of amount of substance and molar mass.

    -   Example: In the reaction 2Mg + O₂ → 2MgO
        -   2 moles of Mg react with 1 mole of O₂ to form 2 moles of MgO
        -   48g of Mg react with 32g of O₂ to form 80g of MgO

1.4 Concentration Calculations

-   Solution Concentration:

    -   Measured in mol dm⁻³ (molarity) or g dm⁻³.

    -   Calculations:
        -   Concentration (mol dm⁻³) = amount of solute (mol) ÷ volume of solution (dm³)
        -   Concentration (g dm⁻³) = mass of solute (g) ÷ volume of solution (dm³)

1.5 Gas Calculations

-   Molar Volume:

    -   One mole of any gas occupies 24 dm³ at room temperature and pressure (RTP).

    -   The molar volume can be used to calculate volumes of gases in reactions.

-   The Ideal Gas Equation:

    -   pV = nRT
        -   p = pressure (Pa)
        -   V = volume (m³)
        -   n = amount of substance (mol)
        -   R = gas constant (8.31 J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹)
        -   T = temperature (K)

1.6 Percentage Yield and Atom Economy

-   Percentage Yield:

    -   Measures the efficiency of a chemical process.

    -   Percentage yield = (actual yield ÷ theoretical yield) × 100%

-   Atom Economy:

    -   Assesses how much of the reactants end up in the desired product.

    -   Atom economy = (molar mass of desired product ÷ sum of molar masses of all reactants) × 100%

    -   High atom economy means less waste and more sustainable processes.

1.7 Practical Applications

-   Simple Test-tube Reactions:

    -   Displacement reactions: A more reactive element displaces a less reactive element from its compound.
        -   Example: Zn(s) + CuSO₄(aq) → ZnSO₄(aq) + Cu(s)

    -   Reactions of acids:
        -   With metals: 2H⁺(aq) + Mg(s) → Mg²⁺(aq) + H₂(g)
        -   With bases: H⁺(aq) + OH⁻(aq) → H₂O(l)
        -   With carbonates: 2H⁺(aq) + CO₃²⁻(aq) → H₂O(l) + CO₂(g)

    -   Precipitation reactions: Formation of an insoluble solid when two solutions are mixed.
        -   Example: Pb²⁺(aq) + 2I⁻(aq) → PbI₂(s)

2. Atomic Structure and the Periodic Table

-   Subatomic Particles:

    -   Protons: Positive charge, mass = 1 atomic mass unit (amu), located in nucleus.

    -   Neutrons: No charge, mass = 1 amu, located in nucleus.

-   Atomic Number and Mass Number:

    -   Atomic (proton) number: Number of protons in an atom (defines the element).

    -   Mass number: Sum of protons and neutrons in an atom.

    -   For an atom, number of electrons = number of protons.

    -   For an ion, number of electrons ≠ number of protons.

2.2 Isotopes and Mass Spectrometry

-   Isotopes:

    -   Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons.

    -   Have the same atomic number but different mass numbers.

    -   Example: Carbon-12 (⁶C¹²) and Carbon-14 (⁶C¹⁴).

    -   Process:
        1. Vaporization of the sample
        2. Ionization (usually by electron bombardment)
        3. Acceleration of ions
        4. Deflection by magnetic field (lighter ions deflected more)
        5. Detection of ions

    -   Mass spectrum shows relative abundance vs mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio.

    -   For diatomic molecules like Cl₂, the peak heights depend on the probability of different isotope combinations.

2.3 Electron Structure and Configuration

-   Energy Levels and Orbitals:

    -   Electrons occupy orbitals within energy levels (quantum shells).

    -   An orbital can hold up to two electrons with opposite spins.

    -   Orbitals have different shapes: s (spherical), p (dumbbell-shaped), d (complex shapes).

-   Electron Configuration Rules:

    -   Orbitals fill according to the Aufbau principle (lowest energy first).

    -   One electron enters each orbital before pairing begins (Hund's rule).

    -   Maximum electrons per shell: 1st shell = 2, 2nd shell = 8, 3rd shell = 18, 4th shell = 32.

        -   Increasing nuclear charge
        -   Same shielding effect
        -   Decreasing atomic radius

    -   Decreases down a group due to:

        -   Group 2 (alkaline earth metals): Higher than Group 1 due to stronger metallic bonding
        -   Group 4 (carbon group): Very high for C and Si due to giant covalent structures
        -   Groups 5-7: Generally low due to simple molecular structures
        -   Group 0 (noble gases): Very low due to weak intermolecular forces

3. Bonding and Structure

    -   Each ion is surrounded by ions of opposite charge.

    -   The arrangement of ions depends on their relative sizes and charges.

-   Factors Affecting Ionic Bond Strength:

    -   Ionic charge: Higher charges create stronger bonds.
        -   Example: Mg²⁺O²⁻ has stronger bonds than Na⁺Cl⁻.

    -   Ionic radius: Smaller ions form stronger bonds due to closer proximity.
        -   Example: LiF has stronger bonds than KI.

-   Trends in Ionic Radii:

    -   Down a group: Ionic radius increases due to additional electron shells.

    -   For isoelectronic ions (same number of electrons):
        -   Radius decreases as nuclear charge increases
        -   Example: N³⁻ > O²⁻ > F⁻ > Na⁺ > Mg²⁺ > Al³⁺

-   Polarization:

    -   Distortion of the electron cloud of an anion by a cation.

    -   Increases with:
        -   Higher charge on the cation
        -   Smaller cation radius
        -   Larger anion
        -   Higher charge on the anion

    -   Greater polarization leads to more covalent character in the bond.

        -   Example: O=O in O₂

    -   Triple bonds: Three shared pairs of electrons (one σ and two π bonds).
        -   Example: N≡N in N₂

    -   Dative covalent (coordinate) bonds: Both electrons in the shared pair come from one atom.
        -   Examples: NH₄⁺, Al₂Cl₆

    -   Bond polarity occurs when there is a significant difference in electronegativity.
        -   Small difference: Non-polar covalent bond
        -   Medium difference: Polar covalent bond
        -   Large difference: Ionic bond

    -   Polar molecules have uneven charge distribution.
        -   A molecule is polar if it has polar bonds arranged asymmetrically.
        -   Example: H₂O is polar, CO₂ is non-polar despite having polar bonds.

3.3 Shapes of Molecules

-   Electron-Pair Repulsion Theory:

    -   Electron pairs (bonding and non-bonding) repel each other.

    -   Electron pairs arrange themselves to minimize repulsion.

    -   The arrangement determines the shape of the molecule.

-   Common Molecular Shapes:

    | Electron Pairs | Lone Pairs | Shape            | Bond Angle | Example    |
    |---------------|------------|------------------|------------|------------|

        -   Hydrogen: Produces only water when burned, but storage is challenging.

    -   Carbon neutrality: When the carbon dioxide released by burning a fuel is balanced by the carbon dioxide absorbed during the growth of the plants used to make the fuel.

-   Reactions of Alkanes:

    -   Generally unreactive (hence the term "paraffins" - little affinity).

    -   Combustion (see above).

    -   Reaction with halogens (chlorine, bromine):
        -   Requires UV light or heat.
        -   Substitution reaction.
        -   Example: CH₄ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + HCl

-   Free Radical Substitution Mechanism:

    -   Initiation:
        -   Cl₂ → 2Cl• (UV light provides energy to break the bond)

    -   Propagation:
        -   Cl• + CH₄ → HCl + •CH₃
        -   •CH₃ + Cl₂ → CH₃Cl + Cl•

    -   Termination:
        -   Cl• + Cl• → Cl₂
        -   •CH₃ + Cl• → CH₃Cl
        -   •CH₃ + •CH₃ → C₂H₆

    -   Limited synthetic value due to further substitution producing a mixture of products.

        -   Alkene + HX → halogenoalkane
        -   X = Cl, Br, I
        -   Example: C₂H₄ + HBr → C₂H₅Br

    -   Addition of steam (hydration):
        -   Alkene + H₂O → alcohol
        -   Requires phosphoric acid catalyst and high temperature/pressure
        -   Example: C₂H₄ + H₂O → C₂H₅OH

    -   Oxidation by potassium manganate(VII):
        -   Cold, dilute, alkaline KMnO₄ (purple) → colorless solution and brown MnO₂
        -   Alkene + [O] + H₂O → diol
        -   Example: C₂H₄ + [O] + H₂O → HOCH₂CH₂OH

-   Test for C=C Double Bond:

    -   Add bromine water (orange/brown) or bromine in an organic solvent.
    -   With alkenes: Solution decolorizes as bromine adds across the double bond.
    -   With alkanes: No change (unless UV light present).

5.4 Electrophilic Addition Mechanisms

-   Addition of bromine:
    1. The π electrons in the alkene attract the slightly positive end of the Br-Br molecule.
    2. A cyclic intermediate forms, distributing charge.
    3. A bromide ion attacks from the opposite side, forming a dibromoalkane.

-   Addition of hydrogen bromide to ethene:
    1. HBr polarizes, with H becoming δ⁺.
    2. The δ⁺ H is attracted to the π electrons.
    3. A carbocation intermediate forms.
    4. Br⁻ attacks the carbocation, forming a bromoalkane.

-   Addition of hydrogen bromide to propene (Markovnikov's rule):
    1. Addition of H⁺ can form two different carbocations.
    2. The secondary carbocation (on the middle carbon) is more stable than the primary.
    3. Therefore, the major product has Br on the middle carbon (2-bromopropane).
    4. "The rich get richer" - hydrogen adds to the carbon with more hydrogens already.

5.5 Addition Polymerization

-   Process:
    -   Many alkene monomers join to form a long-chain polymer.
    -   The double bonds in the monomers become single bonds in the polymer.

-   Representation:
    -   nCH₂=CHX → -(CH₂-CHX)ₙ-

-   Common examples:
    -   Polyethene (from ethene)
    -   Poly(propene) (from propene)
    -   Poly(chloroethene)/PVC (from chloroethene)
    -   Poly(tetrafluoroethene)/PTFE (from tetrafluoroethene)

-   Environmental issues:
    -   Most polymers are non-biodegradable.
    -   Disposal problems:
        -   Landfill: Takes up space, doesn't decompose.
        -   Incineration: Can release toxic gases (e.g., HCl from PVC).
        -   Recycling: Energy-intensive to collect, clean, and reprocess.

-   Solutions:
    -   Developing biodegradable polymers (e.g., polylactic acid from corn starch).
    -   Improving recycling technologies.
    -   Using emission control systems for incineration.
    -   Reducing use through taxation and alternatives.

## Unit 2: Energetics, Group Chemistry, Halogenoalkanes and Alcohols

1. Energetics

1.1 Enthalpy Changes

-   Basic Concepts:

    -   Enthalpy Change (∆H): The heat energy change measured at constant pressure.

    -   Standard Conditions: 100 kPa pressure and usually 298 K (25°C).

    -   Sign Convention:
        -   Exothermic reactions (energy released): Negative ∆H
        -   Endothermic reactions (energy absorbed): Positive ∆H

-   Enthalpy Level Diagrams:

    -   Show the relative enthalpies of reactants and products.

    -   For exothermic reactions, products are lower than reactants.

    -   For endothermic reactions, products are higher than reactants.

1.2 Standard Enthalpy Changes

-   Standard Enthalpy Change of Reaction (∆ᵣH⦵):
    -   The enthalpy change when molar quantities of reactants form products under standard conditions.

-   Standard Enthalpy Change of Formation (∆ᶠH⦵):
    -   The enthalpy change when one mole of a compound is formed from its elements in their standard states.
    -   Elements in their standard states have ∆ᶠH⦵ = 0.

-   Standard Enthalpy Change of Combustion (∆ᶜH⦵):
    -   The enthalpy change when one mole of a substance burns completely in excess oxygen under standard conditions.

-   Standard Enthalpy Change of Neutralization (∆ₙₑᵤₜH⦵):
    -   The enthalpy change when an acid and base react to form one mole of water under standard conditions.

-   Standard Enthalpy Change of Atomization (∆ₐₜH⦵):
    -   The enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous atoms is formed from the element in its standard state.

1.3 Experimental Determination of Enthalpy Changes

-   Calorimetry:

    -   Energy transferred (J) = mass (g) × specific heat capacity (J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹) × temperature change (°C)

    -   For solutions, specific heat capacity is usually assumed to be 4.18 J g⁻¹ °C⁻¹ (same as water).

    -   ∆H = -Energy transferred ÷ amount of substance (mol)

-   Two main experimental methods:

    -   Solution calorimetry: Reactions in an insulated container (e.g., polystyrene cup).

    -   Combustion calorimetry: Burning a substance under a water container and measuring temperature change.

-   Sources of Error and Uncertainty:

    -   Heat loss to surroundings.

    -   Incomplete reactions.

    -   Heat capacity of calorimeter not accounted for.

    -   Uncertainty in measurements of mass, temperature, and volume.

1.4 Hess's Law

-   Principle:

    -   The overall enthalpy change in a reaction is independent of the route taken (provided starting and ending points are the same).

    -   Based on the First Law of Thermodynamics (conservation of energy).

-   Applications:

    -   Calculating enthalpy changes that cannot be measured directly.

    -   Constructing enthalpy cycles to find unknown values.

    -   Finding enthalpy changes of formation from enthalpy changes of combustion.

-   Example Application:

    -   Finding ∆H for A → D when the values of ∆H for A → B, B → C, and C → D are known.
    -   ∆H (A → D) = ∆H (A → B) + ∆H (B → C) + ∆H (C → D)

1.5 Bond Enthalpies

-   Definitions:

    -   Bond Enthalpy: The energy required to break one mole of a particular bond in gaseous molecules.

    -   Mean Bond Enthalpy: The average value of a particular bond enthalpy across different molecules.

-   Calculating Enthalpy Changes:

    -   ∆H = Σ(bonds broken) - Σ(bonds formed)

    -   Bonds broken (endothermic): Positive contribution.

    -   Bonds formed (exothermic): Negative contribution.

-   Limitations:

    -   Only applies to gaseous reactions.

    -   Uses average values, so less accurate than using standard enthalpies.

    -   Doesn't account for intermolecular forces.

-   Bond Strength and Reactivity:

    -   Weaker bonds break more easily and lead to more reactive substances.

    -   Strong bonds (e.g., C≡N, O=O) are less reactive.

    -   Comparing bond enthalpies can help predict which bond will break first in a reaction.

2. Intermolecular Forces

2.1 Types of Intermolecular Forces

-   London Forces (Instantaneous Dipole-Induced Dipole):

    -   Present in all molecules.

    -   Caused by temporary fluctuations in electron distribution.

    -   Strength increases with:
        -   Number of electrons (larger molecules)
        -   Surface area of contact
        -   Ease of distortion of electron cloud (polarizability)

    -   Explains why alkanes have increasing boiling points with increasing chain length.

-   Permanent Dipole-Permanent Dipole Interactions:

    -   Occur between polar molecules.

    -   Result from permanent dipoles (uneven charge distribution).

    -   Stronger than London forces but weaker than hydrogen bonds.

    -   Example: HCl molecules attract each other via their opposite partial charges.

-   Hydrogen Bonds:

    -   Special case of dipole-dipole interaction.

    -   Occurs when H is bonded to a highly electronegative atom (F, O, or N) and is attracted to another electronegative atom.

    -   Much stronger than other intermolecular forces.

    -   Essential in biological systems (e.g., DNA structure, protein folding).

2.2 Hydrogen Bonding in Specific Molecules

-   Water (H₂O):

    -   Each water molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds (two as donor, two as acceptor).

    -   Results in an extensive 3D network in liquid water.

-   Ammonia (NH₃):

    -   Each ammonia molecule can form up to four hydrogen bonds (three as donor, one as acceptor).

    -   Weaker hydrogen bonds than in water due to lower electronegativity of nitrogen.

-   Hydrogen Fluoride (HF):

    -   Each HF molecule can form up to two hydrogen bonds (one as donor, one as acceptor).

    -   Forms zigzag chains in the liquid state.

2.3 Anomalous Properties of Water

-   High Melting and Boiling Points:

    -   Much higher than expected for its molecular mass.

    -   Group 16 hydrides: H₂O, H₂S, H₂Se, H₂Te
        -   Only H₂O is liquid at room temperature; others are gases.
        -   Due to extensive hydrogen bonding in water.

-   Density Anomaly:

    -   Ice is less dense than liquid water (most substances contract when freezing).

    -   In ice, water molecules form a rigid, open hexagonal structure.

    -   When ice melts, some hydrogen bonds break, allowing molecules to pack more closely.

    -   Maximum density at 4°C.

    -   Important for aquatic life (lakes freeze from top down).

2.4 Effect of Intermolecular Forces on Physical Properties

-   Boiling Points of Alkanes:

    -   Increase with chain length due to stronger London forces.

    -   Branching reduces boiling point (less surface area for London forces).

-   Alcohols vs. Alkanes:

    -   Alcohols have much higher boiling points than alkanes with similar numbers of electrons.

    -   Example: Ethanol (C₂H₅OH, b.p. 78°C) vs. propane (C₃H₈, b.p. -42°C).

    -   Due to hydrogen bonding in alcohols.

-   Hydrogen Halides:

    -   Trend in boiling points: HF > HCl > HBr > HI

    -   Anomalous behavior of HF due to hydrogen bonding.

    -   Remaining trend (HCl < HBr < HI) due to increasing London forces.

2.5 Solubility and Solvent Choice

-   Principles:

    -   "Like dissolves like" - substances with similar intermolecular forces dissolve in each other.

    -   Solubility requires sufficient energy to overcome forces in the solute and solvent.

-   Water as a Solvent:

    -   Dissolves ionic compounds through hydration of ions:
        -   Water molecules orient with their appropriate partial charges toward the ions.
        -   Energy released by hydration exceeds the lattice energy needed to separate ions.

    -   Dissolves alcohols through hydrogen bonding.

    -   Poor solvent for non-polar molecules (e.g., alkanes, halogenoalkanes) due to inability to form favorable interactions.

-   Non-Aqueous Solvents:

    -   Non-polar solvents (e.g., hexane) dissolve non-polar solutes.

    -   Polar aprotic solvents (e.g., acetone) dissolve polar substances without forming hydrogen bonds.

    -   Choice depends on:
        -   Required solubility
        -   Reactivity with solutes
        -   Boiling point (for potential removal by evaporation)
        -   Toxicity and environmental impact

3. Redox Chemistry and Groups 1, 2 and 7

        4. Hydrogen: Usually +1 (except in metal hydrides, -1)
        5. Fluorine: Always -1
        6. Other halogens: Usually -1 (except when bonded to oxygen or another halogen)
        7. In a compound, sum of oxidation numbers equals the overall charge

    -   Represented by Roman numerals when naming compounds.
        -   Example: Fe²⁺ = iron(II), Fe³⁺ = iron(III)

-   Redox Reactions:

    -   Oxidation: Loss of electrons, increase in oxidation number.

    -   Reduction: Gain of electrons, decrease in oxidation number.

    -   Oxidizing agent: Accepts electrons (gets reduced).

    -   Reducing agent: Donates electrons (gets oxidized).

-   Disproportionation:

    -   A single element in one oxidation state is simultaneously oxidized and reduced.

    -   Example: 3Cl₂ + 6OH⁻ → 5Cl⁻ + ClO₃⁻ + 3H₂O
        -   Cl₀ is oxidized to Cl⁺⁵ and reduced to Cl⁻¹

-   Half-Equations:

    -   Show the electron transfer in each half of the redox reaction.

    -   Used to construct balanced redox equations.

    -   Example:
        -   Oxidation: Fe²⁺ → Fe³⁺ + e⁻
        -   Reduction: MnO₄⁻ + 8H⁺ + 5e⁻ → Mn²⁺ + 4H₂O

    -   Use white tiles to see color changes more clearly.

    -   Take readings at eye level to avoid parallax error.

4. Introduction to Kinetics and Equilibria

4.1 Kinetics

-   Collision Theory:

    -   Chemical reactions occur when particles collide with:
        -   Sufficient energy (equal to or greater than the activation energy)
        -   Correct orientation

-   Factors Affecting Reaction Rate:

    -   Concentration (or pressure for gases):
        -   Higher concentration means more frequent collisions.
        -   Doubling concentration typically less than doubles the rate.

    -   Temperature:
        -   Higher temperature means more energetic collisions.
        -   Rule of thumb: 10°C increase approximately doubles rate.

    -   Surface area (for solids):
        -   Larger surface area exposes more particles for collision.
        -   Powders react faster than large pieces.

    -   Catalysts:
        -   Provide alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy.
        -   Remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.

-   Measuring Reaction Rates:

    -   Rate = 1/time for a given extent of reaction

    -   Rate = gradient of tangent to a concentration-time curve

    -   Units: mol dm⁻³ s⁻¹ or other appropriate units

-   Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution:

    -   Shows the distribution of molecular energies at a given temperature.

    -   Area under the curve represents the number of molecules.

    -   Effects of temperature:
        -   Higher temperature shifts curve to the right.
        -   More molecules have energy ≥ activation energy.
        -   Explains why rate increases with temperature.

-   Catalysts:

    -   Provide an alternative reaction route with lower activation energy.

    -   Do not change the overall enthalpy change.

    -   Reaction profile shows lower energy barrier for catalyzed reaction.

    -   Industrial importance:
        -   Allow reactions to proceed at lower temperatures (energy saving).
        -   Allow reactions to proceed at lower pressures (safety, equipment costs).
        -   Increase atom economy by promoting selective reactions.

4.2 Equilibria

-   Dynamic Equilibrium:

    -   Forward and reverse reactions occur at the same rate.

    -   Concentrations of reactants and products remain constant.

    -   Closed system (no addition or removal of substances).

-   Le Chatelier's Principle:

    -   "If a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change, the system will respond to oppose the change."

    -   Effects of changes:

        -   Concentration:
            -   Increase in reactant concentration shifts equilibrium to the right.
            -   Increase in product concentration shifts equilibrium to the left.

        -   Pressure (for reactions involving gases):
            -   Increase in pressure favors the side with fewer gas molecules.
            -   No effect if equal numbers of gas molecules on both sides.

        -   Temperature:
            -   Increase in temperature favors the endothermic direction.
            -   Decrease in temperature favors the exothermic direction.

        -   Catalysts:
            -   No effect on position of equilibrium.
            -   Increase rate of both forward and reverse reactions equally.
            -   Allow equilibrium to be reached more quickly.

-   Industrial Applications:

    -   Often require compromise between:
        -   Yield (thermodynamic consideration)
        -   Rate (kinetic consideration)
        -   Cost (economic consideration)

    -   Examples:
        -   Haber process (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃):
            -   High pressure (200 atm) increases yield.
            -   Moderate temperature (450°C) balances yield and rate.
            -   Iron catalyst increases rate without affecting yield.

        -   Contact process (2SO₂ + O₂ ⇌ 2SO₃):
            -   Low temperature increases yield.
            -   V₂O₅ catalyst allows reasonable rate at lower temperature.

-   Evidence:
    -   Rate depends on [propanone] and [H⁺].
    -   Rate independent of [I₂].

    -   Slope = -Ea/R
    -   Ea = -slope × R

-   Using Rate Data:

    -   Calculate k, then follow procedure above

1.8 Catalysis

-   Heterogeneous Catalysis:

    -   Catalyst in different phase from reactants.

    -   Usually solid catalyst with gaseous or liquid reactants.

    -   Steps:

        -   Enzymes in biological systems

2. Entropy and Energetics

2.1 Entropy Concepts

-   Definition of Entropy:

    -   Measure of disorder or randomness in a system.

    -   Related to number of possible ways of arranging particles.

    -   SI unit: J K⁻¹ mol⁻¹

-   Molecular Interpretation:

    -   Positional disorder: Ways particles can be arranged in space.

    -   Energetic disorder: Ways energy can be distributed among particles.

    -   More ways = higher entropy.

-   Factors Affecting Entropy:

    -   Physical state:
        -   Solids (lowest entropy): Fixed positions, limited vibration.
        -   Liquids: More movement but still relatively ordered.
        -   Gases (highest entropy): Free movement in three dimensions.

    -   Temperature:
        -   Higher temperature means more energetic motion and higher entropy.

    -   Complexity of molecules:
        -   More atoms = more ways to vibrate = higher entropy.

    -   Number of gas molecules:
        -   Reactions increasing the number of gas molecules increase entropy.

2.2 Entropy Changes

-   Changes of State:

    -   Solid → Liquid: Entropy increases (more positional freedom).

    -   Liquid → Gas: Larger entropy increase (much more positional freedom).

-   Dissolution of Ionic Solids:

    -   Usually increases entropy:
        -   Ordered crystal lattice → dispersed ions in solution.
        -   May decrease if highly ordered hydration shells form.

-   Changes in Number of Gas Molecules:

    -   Increase in moles of gas: Entropy increases.
        -   Example: CaCO₃(s) → CaO(s) + CO₂(g)

    -   Decrease in moles of gas: Entropy decreases.
        -   Example: N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) → 2NH₃(g)

2.3 Entropy Calculations

-   System Entropy Change:

    -   ΔSsystem = sum of product entropies - sum of reactant entropies
    -   ΔSsystem = Σ(nS°products) - Σ(mS°reactants)
    -   Standard entropies (S°) are absolute values, not changes like ΔH°.

-   Surroundings Entropy Change:

    -   ΔSsurroundings = -ΔH/T
    -   Heat flow to surroundings (negative ΔH) increases surroundings entropy.
    -   Heat flow from surroundings (positive ΔH) decreases surroundings entropy.

-   Total Entropy Change:

    -   ΔStotal = ΔSsystem + ΔSsurroundings
    -   For reaction feasibility: ΔStotal must be positive.

2.4 Reaction Feasibility

-   Criterion for Spontaneous Change:

    -   ΔStotal > 0: Reaction is feasible (will occur spontaneously).
    -   ΔStotal = 0: System at equilibrium.
    -   ΔStotal < 0: Reaction is not feasible in direction written.

-   Temperature Dependence:

    -   Increasing temperature:
        -   Reduces impact of ΔSsurroundings (because ΔSsurroundings = -ΔH/T).
        -   Makes endothermic reactions more feasible if ΔSsystem is positive.

    -   Decreasing temperature:
        -   Increases impact of ΔSsurroundings.
        -   Makes exothermic reactions more feasible even if ΔSsystem is negative.

-   Determining Feasibility Temperature:

    -   When ΔStotal = 0, reaction is at equilibrium.
    -   ΔSsystem + ΔSsurroundings = 0
    -   ΔSsystem - ΔH/T = 0
    -   T = ΔH/ΔSsystem
    -   Above this temperature, endothermic reactions with positive ΔSsystem become feasible.

2.5 Thermodynamic and Kinetic Stability

-   Thermodynamic Stability:

    -   Relates to the position of equilibrium.
    -   Determined by the total entropy change.
    -   Thermodynamically stable = lowest energy state.
    -   Diamond is thermodynamically unstable compared to graphite at room temperature and pressure (but conversion is extremely slow).

-   Kinetic Stability:

    -   Relates to the rate of reaction.
    -   Determined by the activation energy.
    -   Kinetically stable = high activation energy barrier.
    -   Many thermodynamically feasible reactions don't occur at measurable rates due to kinetic barriers.
    -   Example: H₂ and O₂ mixture is thermodynamically unstable but kinetically stable until ignited.

2.6 Lattice Energy

-   Definition:

    -   The energy released when one mole of an ionic solid forms from its gaseous ions.

    -   Always exothermic for stable ionic compounds.

-   Born-Haber Cycle:

    -   Thermodynamic cycle using Hess's Law to calculate lattice energy.

    -   Steps (for formation of NaCl):
        1. Atomization of Na(s): Na(s) → Na(g) (endothermic, ΔHat)
        2. Ionization of Na(g): Na(g) → Na⁺(g) + e⁻ (endothermic, IEₙₐ)
        3. Atomization of Cl₂(g): ½Cl₂(g) → Cl(g) (endothermic, ΔHat)
        4. Electron affinity of Cl: Cl(g) + e⁻ → Cl⁻(g) (exothermic, EAcl)
        5. Lattice formation: Na⁺(g) + Cl⁻(g) → NaCl(s) (exothermic, LE)

    -   ΔHf(NaCl) = ΔHat(Na) + IEₙₐ + ½ΔHat(Cl₂) + EAcl + LE

-   Factors Affecting Lattice Energy:

    -   Ionic Charge:
        -   Higher charges lead to stronger attractions and larger lattice energies.
        -   Example: MgO has higher lattice energy than NaCl (2+/2- vs. 1+/1-).

    -   Ionic Radius:
        -   Smaller ions create stronger lattice energies (closer approach).
        -   Example: LiF has higher lattice energy than KI (smaller ions).

-   Experimental vs. Theoretical Values:

    -   Experimental values from Born-Haber cycle.

    -   Theoretical values from electrostatic theory.

    -   Discrepancy indicates covalent character:
        -   Experimental > theoretical: Significant covalent character.
        -   Example: Silver halides show significant covalent bonding.

2.7 Covalent Character in Ionic Bonds

-   Polarization:

    -   Distortion of anion electron cloud by the electric field of the cation.

    -   Greater polarization leads to more covalent character.

-   Factors Increasing Polarization:

    -   Small, highly charged cations (high polarizing power).
        -   Example: Al³⁺ more polarizing than Na⁺

    -   Large, highly charged anions (high polarizability).
        -   Example: I⁻ more polarizable than F⁻

    -   Example: AlCl₃ has significant covalent character despite formula suggesting ionic bonding.

2.8 Enthalpy of Solution

-   Enthalpy Change of Solution (ΔsolH):

    -   The enthalpy change when one mole of substance dissolves in a solvent.

    -   Can be endothermic (most NH₄⁺ salts) or exothermic (most Li⁺ salts).

-   Enthalpy Cycle:

    -   Solvation = breaking lattice + hydrating ions
    -   ΔsolH = lattice energy + Σ(enthalpy of hydration)
    -   Lattice energy is endothermic when written as breaking the lattice.

-   Enthalpy of Hydration (ΔhydH):

    -   The enthalpy change when one mole of gaseous ions dissolves in water.

    -   Always exothermic due to ion-dipole interactions.

    -   More exothermic for:
        -   Smaller ions (closer approach to water)
        -   Higher charge (stronger attraction)

-   Predicting Solubility:

    -   For solution to be favorable: ΔsolH + TΔS > 0

    -   Usually, if ΔsolH is highly endothermic, compound is insoluble.

    -   If ΔsolH is exothermic, compound is usually soluble.

    -   Entropy increase from dispersion often drives dissolution even with slightly endothermic ΔsolH.

3. Chemical Equilibria

3.1 Equilibrium Constants

-   Equilibrium Constant Expressions:

    -   For homogeneous equilibrium aA + bB ⇌ cC + dD:
        -   Kc = [C]^c[D]^d / [A]^a[B]^b
        -   Concentrations in mol dm⁻³

    -   For heterogeneous equilibrium involving solids or pure liquids:
        -   Pure solids and liquids omitted from expression
        -   Example: CaCO₃(s) ⇌ CaO(s) + CO₂(g)
        -   Kc = [CO₂]

-   Equilibrium Constant Units:

    -   Units depend on overall change in moles of gaseous/aqueous species.
    -   If Δn = 0, Kc is unitless.
    -   If Δn ≠ 0, units are (mol dm⁻³)^Δn.

-   Partial Pressure Equilibrium Constant:

    -   For gas-phase equilibria:
        -   Kp = (PC)^c(PD)^d / (PA)^a(PB)^b
        -   Partial pressures in atmospheres (atm)

    -   Relationship with Kc:
        -   Kp = Kc(RT)^Δn
        -   Where Δn is the change in moles of gas

3.2 Calculating Equilibrium Constants

-   From Experimental Data:

    -   Measure equilibrium concentrations.
    -   Substitute into equilibrium expression.
    -   Example: For N₂(g) + 3H₂(g) ⇌ 2NH₃(g)
        -   If [N₂] = 0.1, [H₂] = 0.2, and [NH₃] = 0.3 mol dm⁻³
        -   Kc = [NH₃]²/([N₂][H₂]³) = 0.3²/(0.1×0.2³) = 112.5 mol⁻² dm⁶

-   From Equilibrium Composition:

    -   Often given initial amounts and equilibrium amount of one species.
    -   Use stoichiometry to find other equilibrium concentrations.
    -   Construct ICE table (Initial, Change, Equilibrium).

-   Units of Equilibrium Constants:

    -   For Kc, depends on Δn (change in moles of aqueous/gaseous species).
    -   For example, in N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃, Δn = 2 - (1 + 3) = -2
    -   Units are (mol dm⁻³)⁻² or mol⁻² dm⁶

3.3 Effect of Changes on Equilibrium

-   Le Chatelier's Principle:

    -   When a system at equilibrium is disturbed, the equilibrium shifts to minimize the disturbance.

-   Effect of Concentration Changes:

    -   Increasing reactant concentration shifts equilibrium right.
    -   Increasing product concentration shifts equilibrium left.
    -   Adding or removing solids or pure liquids has no effect on position.

-   Effect of Pressure Changes:

    -   Increasing pressure favors side with fewer gas molecules.
    -   No effect if equal numbers of gas molecules on both sides.
    -   Example: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃
        -   4 moles of gas → 2 moles of gas
        -   Increasing pressure favors NH₃ formation

-   Effect of Temperature Changes:

    -   Increasing temperature favors endothermic direction.
    -   Decreasing temperature favors exothermic direction.
    -   Example: N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃ (exothermic forward)
        -   Increasing temperature reduces NH₃ yield
        -   Decreasing temperature increases NH₃ yield

-   Effect of Catalysts:

    -   No effect on position of equilibrium or value of K.
    -   Increases rate of both forward and reverse reactions equally.
    -   Allows equilibrium to be reached more quickly.

3.4 Temperature and Equilibrium Constants

-   Relationship with Temperature:

    -   For exothermic reactions (negative ΔH):
        -   K decreases as temperature increases.

    -   For endothermic reactions (positive ΔH):
        -   K increases as temperature increases.

-   Mathematical Relationship:

    -   ln K = -ΔH/RT + ΔS/R
    -   Or: ΔStotal = R ln K
    -   Shows direct link between equilibrium constant and total entropy change.

-   Van 't Hoff Equation:

    -   ln(K₂/K₁) = (ΔH/R)(1/T₁ - 1/T₂)
    -   Allows calculation of K at different temperatures.

3.5 Industrial Applications

-   Balancing Factors:

    -   Yield (thermodynamic consideration).
    -   Rate (kinetic consideration).
    -   Cost (economic consideration).

-   Haber Process (N₂ + 3H₂ ⇌ 2NH₃):

    -   Conditions:
        -   Temperature: ~450°C (compromise between rate and yield)
        -   Pressure: ~200 atm (increases yield but expensive)
        -   Catalyst: Iron (increases rate without affecting yield)

    -   Economics:
        -   Continuous process with recycling of unreacted gases
        -   Only ~15% conversion per pass but economically viable

-   Contact Process (2SO₂ + O₂ ⇌ 2SO₃):

    -   Conditions:
        -   Temperature: ~450°C (compromise)
        -   Pressure: 1-2 atm (small benefit from higher pressure)
        -   Catalyst: V₂O₅ (allows lower temperature)

    -   Economics:
        -   Multiple catalyst beds with intermediate cooling
        -   ~98% conversion overall

4. Acid-Base Equilibria

4.1 Brønsted-Lowry Theory

-   Definitions:

    -   Brønsted-Lowry acid: Proton (H⁺) donor.

    -   Brønsted-Lowry base: Proton (H⁺) acceptor.

    -   Acid-base reaction: Proton transfer from acid to base.

-   Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs:

    -   When an acid loses H⁺, it becomes a conjugate base.

    -   When a base gains H⁺, it becomes a conjugate acid.

    -   Examples:
        -   HCl (acid) and Cl⁻ (conjugate base)
        -   NH₃ (base) and NH₄⁺ (conjugate acid)

    -   Stronger acids have weaker conjugate bases and vice versa.

    -   Where [H⁺] is in mol dm⁻³

-   pH Values:

    -   Acidic solutions: pH < 7
    -   Neutral solutions: pH = 7 (at 25°C)
    -   Alkaline solutions: pH > 7

-   Calculating pH:

    -   From [H⁺]: pH = -log₁₀[H⁺]
    -   From [OH⁻]: pH = 14 + log₁₀[OH⁻] (at 25°C)
    -   From pH to [H⁺]: [H⁺] = 10⁻ᵖᴴ

4.3 Strong and Weak Acids

-   Strong Acids:

    -   Completely dissociate in water.
    -   [H⁺] = initial acid concentration.
    -   Examples: HCl, HNO₃, H₂SO₄ (first dissociation)
    -   pH = -log₁₀(acid concentration)

-   Weak Acids:

    -   Partially dissociate in water, establishing equilibrium.
    -   HA ⇌ H⁺ + A⁻
    -   Examples: CH₃COOH, HF, H₂CO₃

    -   Acid Dissociation Constant:
        -   Ka = [H⁺][A⁻]/[HA]
        -   pKa = -log₁₀(Ka)
        -   Larger Ka (smaller pKa) = stronger acid

    -   Calculating pH:
        -   For weak acid of concentration c:
        -   [H⁺] = √(Ka × c) (assuming Ka « c)
        -   pH = ½(pKa - log₁₀c)

    -   E⁰cell = E⁰(reduction) - E⁰(oxidation)
    -   E⁰cell = E⁰(cathode) - E⁰(anode)

-   Electrochemical Series:

    -   List of reduction half-equations in order of increasing E⁰ values.

    -   More positive E⁰: Better oxidizing agent (more readily reduced).

    -   E⁰cell = 0: System at equilibrium.

-   Limitations:

-   Implications:

    -   Large positive E⁰cell corresponds to large K (equilibrium lies far to right).

    -   E⁰cell = 0 corresponds to K = 1 (equilibrium lies exactly in middle).

    -   Large negative E⁰cell corresponds to small K (equilibrium lies far to left).

    -   Element must exist in at least three oxidation states.

-   Predicting Feasibility:

    -   If E⁰ for oxidation > E⁰ for reduction: Disproportionation feasible.

    -   Example: Cu⁺ → Cu²⁺ + Cu
        -   Cu⁺ + e⁻ → Cu (E⁰ = +0.52 V)
        -   Cu²⁺ + e⁻ → Cu⁺ (E⁰ = +0.15 V)
