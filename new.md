# 1. Respiration

## 1.1 Aerobic Respiration

### Overall Process:
- Aerobic respiration splits respiratory substrates (glucose) to release carbon dioxide as a waste product.
- Hydrogen from the substrate combines with atmospheric oxygen, releasing large amounts of energy.
- The process is stepped, with each step controlled and catalyzed by specific intracellular enzymes.

### Stages of Respiration:
- **Glycolysis**: Occurs in the cytoplasm.
- **Link Reaction and Krebs Cycle**: Occur in the mitochondria.
- **Electron Transport Chain**: Located in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

## 1.2 Glycolysis

### Process:
- Takes place in the cytoplasm of cells.
- Glucose (6C) is phosphorylated using ATP and split into two molecules of pyruvate (3C).
- Produces a net gain of 2 ATP through substrate-level phosphorylation.
- Produces 2 reduced NAD (NADH) by dehydrogenation.

### Outcomes:
- **In aerobic conditions**: Pyruvate enters the link reaction.
- **In anaerobic conditions**:
  - **In animals**: Pyruvate is converted to lactate to regenerate NAD.
  - **In plants and microorganisms**: Pyruvate is converted to ethanol and carbon dioxide.

## 1.3 Link Reaction and Krebs Cycle

### Link Reaction:
- Occurs in the mitochondrial matrix.
- Pyruvate (3C) is decarboxylated to form acetyl CoA (2C).
- One CO₂ molecule is released.
- One molecule of NAD is reduced to NADH.

### Krebs Cycle:
- Takes place in the mitochondrial matrix.
- Acetyl CoA (2C) combines with oxaloacetate (4C) to form citrate (6C).
- Through a series of reactions, citrate is converted back to oxaloacetate.
- For each acetyl CoA molecule:
  - Two CO₂ molecules are released by decarboxylation.
  - Three NAD molecules are reduced to NADH.
  - One FAD molecule is reduced to FADH₂.
  - One ATP is generated by substrate-level phosphorylation.

## 1.4 Electron Transport Chain and Oxidative Phosphorylation

### Location and Structure:
- Embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.
- Consists of a series of electron carriers (protein complexes).

### Process:
- Electrons from reduced NAD and FAD pass down the chain, releasing energy.
- Oxygen acts as the final electron acceptor, combining with hydrogen ions to form water.
- Energy released pumps protons (H⁺) from the matrix into the intermembrane space, creating a proton gradient.

### Chemiosmosis:
- The proton gradient represents potential energy (proton-motive force).
- Protons flow back into the matrix through ATP synthase.
- ATP synthase uses this energy to phosphorylate ADP to ATP.
- This process is called oxidative phosphorylation.

## 1.5 Anaerobic Respiration

### Process in Animals:
- During intense exercise, oxygen may become limiting.
- Pyruvate is reduced to lactate, regenerating NAD for glycolysis to continue.
- Less efficient: Only 2 ATP per glucose molecule (compared to 30-32 in aerobic respiration).

### Lactate Fate:
- When oxygen becomes available, lactate is converted back to pyruvate in the liver.
- Some lactate is converted to glucose via gluconeogenesis.
- This process creates an oxygen debt that must be repaid during recovery.

## 1.6 Respiratory Quotient (RQ)

### Definition:
- The ratio of carbon dioxide produced to oxygen consumed during respiration.
- RQ = Volume of CO₂ produced ÷ Volume of O₂ consumed

### Significance:
- Indicates the respiratory substrate being used:
  - **Carbohydrates**: RQ = 1.0
  - **Proteins**: RQ = 0.9
  - **Lipids**: RQ = 0.7
  - **Mixed diet**: RQ = 0.8-0.9
- Can be measured using a respirometer.

# 2. Muscle Structure and Movement

## 2.1 Skeletal System and Movement

### Components of Movement:
- **Bones**: Provide rigid framework and attachment points.
- **Muscles**: Generate force through contraction.
- **Tendons**: Connect muscles to bones.
- **Ligaments**: Connect bones to other bones at joints.

### Antagonistic Muscle Pairs:
- **Flexors**: Decrease the angle at a joint (e.g., biceps).
- **Extensors**: Increase the angle at a joint (e.g., triceps).
- Work in opposition: When one contracts, the other relaxes.

## 2.2 Skeletal Muscle Structure

### Hierarchical Organization:
- Whole muscle → Fascicles → Muscle fibers → Myofibrils → Sarcomeres

### Muscle Fiber Features:
- Multinucleated cells with nuclei at the periphery.
- Filled with myofibrils containing contractile proteins.
- Sarcoplasmic reticulum stores calcium ions.
- T-tubules conduct electrical impulses into the fiber.
- Numerous mitochondria provide ATP for contraction.

### Sarcomere Structure:
- The functional unit of contraction.
- Bounded by Z lines with an M line in the center.
- Contains thick filaments (myosin) and thin filaments (actin, tropomyosin, troponin).
- Creates the characteristic striated appearance:
  - **A band**: Region containing thick filaments.
  - **I band**: Region containing only thin filaments.
  - **H zone**: Central region of thick filaments only.

## 2.3 Muscle Fiber Types

### Fast Twitch Fibers:
- Specialized for rapid, powerful contractions.
- Contain few mitochondria and little myoglobin.

### Slow Twitch Fibers:
- Specialized for sustained, low-intensity contractions.
- Contain many mitochondria and much myoglobin (giving a red appearance).
- Primarily use aerobic respiration.
- Resistant to fatigue.
- Used in endurance activities (marathon running, maintaining posture).

## 2.4 Sliding Filament Theory

### Process of Contraction:
- Motor neuron stimulation releases acetylcholine at the neuromuscular junction.
- Action potential travels along the sarcolemma and into T-tubules.
- Calcium ions are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.
- Calcium binds to troponin, causing tropomyosin to move and expose binding sites on actin.
- Myosin heads bind to actin, forming cross-bridges.
- ATP binds to myosin, causing it to detach from actin.
- ATP hydrolysis energizes the myosin head.
- Myosin reattaches to actin at a new position and pulls, creating the power stroke.
- The cycle repeats, pulling thin filaments toward the center of the sarcomere.

### Contraction Results:
- Z lines move closer together.
- H zone and I band narrow.
- A band length remains constant.
- The sarcomere shortens, causing muscle contraction.

## 2.5 Cardiac Muscle

### Structure:
- Branched cells with a single nucleus.
- Contains intercalated discs with gap junctions for electrical coupling.
- Abundant mitochondria for continuous ATP production.

### Myogenic Nature:
- Cardiac muscle can contract without neural stimulation.
- Pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node (SAN) initiate the heartbeat.

### Electrical Coordination:
- **Sinoatrial Node (SAN)**: The natural pacemaker in the right atrium wall.
- **Atrioventricular Node (AVN)**: Delays the impulse before passing it to the ventricles.

- Normal resting value: ~5 liters/minute.
- Can increase to 20-25 liters/minute during intense exercise.

### Control Centers in the Medulla Oblongata:
- **Cardiovascular Control Center**: Regulates heart rate and blood pressure.
- **Ventilation Center**: Controls breathing rate and depth.

### Exercise Response:
- Increased oxygen demand triggers faster breathing and heart rate.
- Carbon dioxide removal is accelerated to maintain blood pH.
- Sympathetic nervous system increases cardiac output.
- Adrenaline is released during the "fight or flight" response:
  - Increases heart rate and force of contraction.
  - Dilates airways (bronchioles).
  - Increases blood glucose for energy.
  - Redirects blood flow to muscles and away from digestive organs.

# 3. Homeostasis and Feedback

## 3.1 Principles of Homeostasis

### Definition:
- The maintenance of a stable internal environment despite changes in the external environment.
- Crucial for optimal enzyme function and cellular processes.

### Regulated Variables:
- Body temperature.
- Blood glucose concentration.
- Blood water potential (osmotic balance).
- Carbon dioxide levels.
- pH balance.

## 3.2 Feedback Control

### Negative Feedback:
- The response to a change is opposite to the change itself.
- Returns the system to the set point when deviations occur.
- Example: When body temperature rises, sweating increases to lower temperature.

### Positive Feedback:
- The response to a change amplifies the original change.
- Moves the system further away from equilibrium.
- Less common in homeostatic systems.
- Examples: Blood clotting, childbirth contractions.

### Components of a Feedback System:
- **Receptor**: Detects changes in the internal environment.
- **Control Center**: Processes information and determines response.
- **Effector**: Carries out the response to restore balance.

## 3.3 Thermoregulation

### The Hypothalamus:
- Contains thermoreceptors that detect blood temperature.
- Acts as the body's thermostat, maintaining temperature around 37°C.

### Responses to High Temperature:
- **Vasodilation**: Blood vessels near the skin surface widen, increasing heat loss.
- **Sweating**: Evaporation of sweat removes heat from the body.
- **Reduced metabolic rate**: Decreases heat generation.

### Responses to Low Temperature:
- **Vasoconstriction**: Blood vessels near the skin surface narrow, reducing heat loss.
- **Shivering**: Involuntary muscle contractions generate heat.
- **Increased metabolic rate**: Increases heat generation.
- **Release of thyroxine**: Stimulates metabolism and heat production.

### Thermoregulation During Exercise:

  - **Distal convoluted tubule**: Fine regulation of water and ion balance.
  - **Collecting duct**: Final water reabsorption under hormonal control.

## 3.5 Urine Formation

### Process:
- **Ultrafiltration**:
  - Blood pressure forces small molecules from the blood into Bowman's capsule.
  - Blood cells and proteins remain in the blood.
- **Selective Reabsorption**:
  - Useful substances (glucose, amino acids, vitamins) are actively reabsorbed in the proximal tubule.
  - Sodium ions are actively reabsorbed throughout the tubule.
  - Water follows by osmosis.
- **The Loop of Henle**:
  - Functions as a countercurrent multiplier.
  - Creates an increasing concentration gradient from cortex to medulla.
  - Descending limb: Permeable to water, not to ions.
  - Ascending limb: Impermeable to water, actively transports ions out.

### Urea:
- Produced in the liver from excess amino acids via the ornithine cycle.
- Transported in the blood to the kidneys.
- Filtered at the glomerulus and partially reabsorbed in the collecting duct.
- Helps maintain the concentration gradient in the medulla.

## 3.6 Osmoregulation

### Antidiuretic Hormone (ADH):
- Produced by the hypothalamus and stored in the posterior pituitary gland.
- Release controlled by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.

### Negative Feedback Control:
- **High blood osmolarity (low water potential)**:
  - Detected by osmoreceptors in the hypothalamus.
  - Stimulates ADH release from the posterior pituitary.
  - ADH increases permeability of collecting ducts to water.
  - More water is reabsorbed, producing concentrated urine.
  - Blood osmolarity decreases towards normal levels.
- **Low blood osmolarity (high water potential)**:
  - Inhibits ADH release.
  - Collecting ducts become less permeable to water.
  - Less water is reabsorbed, producing dilute urine.
  - Blood osmolarity increases towards normal levels.

  - Potassium channels open.
  - K⁺ ions flow out of the cell.
  - Membrane potential returns to negative.
- **Hyperpolarization**:
  - Membrane potential overshoots to below -70mV.
  - Potassium channels close.
  - Sodium-potassium pump restores resting potential.

### Saltatory Conduction:
- In myelinated axons, action potentials "jump" from one node of Ranvier to the next.
- Faster than continuous conduction in unmyelinated axons.
- Conserves energy by restricting ion movement to nodes only.

## 4.4 Synaptic Transmission

### Structure of a Synapse:

### Transmission Process:
- Action potential arrives at the presynaptic terminal.
- Voltage-gated calcium channels open.
- Calcium ions enter, causing synaptic vesicles to fuse with the membrane.
- Neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft.
- Neurotransmitters bind to receptors on the postsynaptic membrane.
- Postsynaptic membrane becomes more permeable to ions.
- This may cause excitation (depolarization) or inhibition (hyperpolarization).

### Acetylcholine:

## 5.4 Sensory Reception

### Photoreception in the Retina:
- **Rod Cells**:
  - Responsible for vision in dim light.
  - Contain rhodopsin, composed of opsin protein and retinal.
  - Light causes retinal to change shape, initiating a cascade of reactions.
